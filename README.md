End to end Power BI project

- I am excited to share my learnings in Power BI project from codebasics. During this journey, I have learnt many new concepts and enjoyed a lot while working on this project. To start with, Power BI is excel on steroids. It is easier and faster to build dashboards in Power BI than in excel when dealing with large data.

**Workflow steps:**

1.	Project planning and scoping.
2.	Project Charter is the document containing key details like objective of the project, information about the stakeholders, hopes and fears regarding the project, timeline details, success measures, feature creep etc.
3.	Data collection and exploration, create date table in Power Query (M language).
4.	Soft skills associated with project management like asking all the questions proactively, having proper communication from time to time to deliver meaningful solution in the given time.
5.	Data load to Power BI and initial validation.
6.	Data Transformation in Power Query.
7.	Data Modelling and creating calculated columns.
8.	Creating measures using the DAX language.
9.	Build Finance View, Sales View, Market & Supply Chain View.
10.	Designing an effective Dashboard which includes page navigation with buttons, dynamic titles based on the applied filters, using KPI’s, conditional formatting of the values in visuals based on target values.
11.	Data validation set up like creating user acceptance test report.
12.	Implementing stakeholder feedback like switching between dynamic targets, using what-if parameter and measures to create dynamic slicer to filter visual, using bookmarks to switch between visuals, creating tooltip to show the trend, creating Executive dashboard.
13.	Deploying the solution using Power BI Service, report sharing.
14.	Automatic data refresh using gateways.
